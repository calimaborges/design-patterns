OO Basics
=========

* Abstraction
* Encapsulation
* Polymorphism
* Inheritance

OO Principles
=============

* Encapsulate what varies
* Favor composition over inheritance
* Program to interfaces, not implementations


OO Patterns
===========

* **Strategy** - defines a family of algorithms encapsulates each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.


Bullet Points
=============
* Knowing the OO basics does not make you a good OO designer
* Good OO designs are reusable, extensible and maintainable.
* Patterns show you how to build systems with good OO design qualities.
* Patterns are proven object-oriented experience.
* Patterns don't give you code, they give you general solutions to design problems. You apply them to your specific application.
* Patterns aren't *invented*, they are *discovered*.
* Most patterns and principles address issues of *change* in software.
* Most patterns allow some part of a system to vary independently of all other parts.
* We often try to take what varies in a system and encapsulate it.
* Patterns provide a shared language that can maximize the value of your communication with other developers.
